## Introduction

Quantum Mathematician bridges the gap between classical constraint-solving techniques and quantum computing. By utilizing Python's Z3 SMT solver for defining and managing graph constraints and Q# for handling quantum-accelerated optimization tasks, the project aims to achieve efficient and scalable solutions to complex mathematical problems.

## Features

- **Constraint Definition:** Utilize Python and Z3 to define and manage graph-related constraints.
- **Quantum Optimization:** Identify and implement quantum-suitable subtasks to enhance computational efficiency.
- **Agent Creation:** One can deploy curicculum learning or task-oriented agents. 

## Architecture

The project follows a hybrid computational model combining classical and quantum computing paradigms:

1. **Classical Layer (Python):** Handles constraint definitions, graph generation, and overall orchestration using Python and Z3.
2. **Quantum Layer (Q#):** Implements quantum algorithms to optimize specific subtasks identified within the problem domain.
3. **Integration Layer:** Facilitates communication between Python and Q# using interoperability features, ensuring smooth data exchange and result aggregation.
