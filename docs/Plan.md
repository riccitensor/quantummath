# Quantum Mathematician Architecture Planning - WIP

## 1. Foundation Layer: Mathematical Formalization and Storage

- **Lean**: Serves as the primary formalization language and repository. Lean structures mathematical definitions, theorems, and proofs.
- **TPTP Format**: Utilized for interoperability between different theorem provers and for storing problem statements in a standardized form.
- **Quantum Programming (Q#)**: Encodes quantum-specific operations for calculations beyond classical reach, useful in quantum proofs or generating insights on complex systems.

## 2. Computational Engine Layer: Automated Reasoning and Proof Search

- **SMT Solver (Z3)**: Efficiently handles logical consistency checks, model validation, and finite-domain search tasks within classical and quantum setups.
- **Vampire (and other ATPs)**: Applies advanced automated reasoning for first-order logic and proof search, which also interacts with Leanâ€™s formalized theorems.
- **Equivalence Graphs (Egg)**: Manages transformations and equivalences, facilitating optimization and checking consistency in mathematical structures.

## 3. AI Agent Layer: Task Distribution, Parallelization, and Learning

- **AI Agents for Specialized Tasks**: Design agents specialized in:
  - **Theorem Proving**: Use Lean and Vampire to explore and formalize proofs.
  - **Quantum Computation**: Use Q# for quantum algorithm design and verification.
  - **Optimization**: Use Egg and Z3 for rewriting and optimizing expressions.
- **Parallelization & Distribution**: Agents work in parallel to saturate and complete equation sets, employing both heuristic and machine-learned strategies.

## 4. Knowledge Graph & Database Layer: Structured Knowledge Management

- **Data Graphs for Proven Structures**: Organize theorem interdependencies, proof steps, and concepts into a structured, accessible graph.
- **Storing and Retrieving Equations**: Support resilient equation tracking, including challenge equations (1323, 1516, 1729, 1485, and 854), while indexing findings based on equivalences, implications, and unique invariants.

## 5. Interface Layer: Interaction and Visualization

- **Dashboard Interface**: Showcases outcomes, displays implication chains, and allows real-time interaction with active proofs and equations.
- **Reporting, Blueprint and Collaboration Engine**: Suggests new avenues or refinements based on successful proof patterns, especially useful for focus areas in groupoids, magmas, and Horn theories.
